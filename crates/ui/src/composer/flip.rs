// the inner bottom) rode the animating height up and down. The controls are
// therefore pinned to the stationary bottom edge (absolute bottom row when
// expanded, a bottom-justified row when compact) and only the TEXT glides
// with the sweeping top edge. The helpers below are the pure math.

/// mode (`pb-2.5` 10 + half the 32px content zone + 1px hairline) but 24.5px

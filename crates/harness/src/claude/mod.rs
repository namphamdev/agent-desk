//! Claude Code catalog: models, effort ladders, and the Ultrathink prompt
//! convention. The protocol adapter itself is the shared ACP harness
//! ([crate::AcpHarness::claude], via the org-maintained claude-agent-acp
//! adapter on the Claude Agent SDK) — the bespoke stream-json harness this
//! module used to hold was retired with the ACP conversion
//! (docs/research/acp.md).
